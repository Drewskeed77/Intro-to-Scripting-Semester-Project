# Project Zomboid Modding Tool

# Overview

The Project Zomboid Modding Tool aims to simplify and streamline the modding process for Project Zomboid, a popular survival game. Modding in Project Zomboid can be tedious and time-consuming due to the need for manual setup of mod structures, defining game items, and other repetitive tasks. This tool aims to automate much of this work, enabling modders to focus on creative content rather than setup.

This tool will be a cross-platform solution, designed to work on both Windows and Linux environments, leveraging Python for the backend, with Bash and Batch scripting to ensure compatibility across operating systems. It will allow users to quickly generate mod directories, create items, recipes, and other mod assets with minimal effort.
